# Homebrew formula. This repository is its own tap:
#   brew tap dwagwd/quotapilot https://github.com/dwagwd/quotapilot
#   brew install dwagwd/quotapilot/quotapilot
# When the formula has a `bottle do` block, Homebrew downloads that prebuilt package (built and ad-hoc signed
# on GitHub's runners, never on a personal machine). Otherwise, and on Macs the bottle does not cover,
# QuotaPilot is built from source on your Mac (about two minutes) and ad-hoc signed there.
